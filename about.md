# About Me

Anamika Agrawal is a Shanahan Foundation Fellow at the Allen Institute and the University of Washington. She received her Ph.D. in Physics from UC San Diego, working with Prof. Elena Koslover. During her graduate studies, she became interested in the interplay of intracellular dynamics and neuronal morphology, with her work focusing on mitochondrial organization.

Drawing inspiration from her specialization in Quantitative Biology at UCSD, she enjoys working with simple analytical and computational models that still preserve the relevant biological complexity of the involved data. During the fellowship, she is interested in understanding how cell-type-specific neuronal properties, such as morphology and transcriptomics, contribute to neuronal function and dysfunction. She uses biophysically-inspired Bayesian inference and machine learning models for her work.
